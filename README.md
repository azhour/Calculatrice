# Calculatrice

## Instructions:

Realize an interactive calculator which allows to realize simple actions (additions,
subtractions, mutliplications, divisions) and displays the result on the screen.

Simple version: the whole operation is displayed on the screen and when the user clicks on the
result is displayed.  
User can delete items in the operation if he wishes.

Advanced version: the calculator behaves like an Android or Ios calculator, the operation
is never displayed as a whole screen, the current result of the operation is displayed
whenever the user clicks on an operator.
